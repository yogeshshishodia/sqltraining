-- Joining tables

-- Table & Column Aliases – introduce you to table and column aliases.
-- Joins  – give you an overview of joins supported in MySQL including inner join, left join, and right join.
-- INNER JOIN – query rows from a table that has matching rows in another table.
-- LEFT JOIN – return all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table or null if no matching rows found in the right table.
-- RIGHT JOIN – return all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table or null if no matching rows found in the left table.
-- CROSS JOIN – make a Cartesian product of rows from multiple tables.
-- Self-join – join a table to itself using table alias and connect rows within the same table using inner join and left join.

-- Joins practice
-- Setting up sample tables
-- First, create two tables called members and committees:
-- 

CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE committees (
    committee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (committee_id)
);

-- Second, insert some rows into the tables members and committees :
INSERT INTO members(name)
VALUES('John'),('Jane'),('Mary'),('David'),('Amelia');

INSERT INTO committees(name)
VALUES('John'),('Mary'),('Amelia'),('Joe');

-- Third, query data from the tables members and committees:

SELECT * FROM members;

SELECT * FROM committees;

-- MySQL INNER JOIN clause
-- syntax
SELECT column_list
FROM table_1
INNER JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

-- nner join clause to find members who are also the committee members:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
INNER JOIN committees c ON c.name = m.name;

-- Because both tables use the same column to match, you can use the USING clause as shown in the following query:
SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
INNER JOIN committees c USING(name);


-- MySQL LEFT JOIN clause
-- basic syntax of a left join clause that joins two tables:
SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
LEFT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

-- The left join also supports the USING clause if the column used for matching in both tables are the same:
SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
LEFT JOIN table_2 USING (column_name);

--  left join clause to join the members with the committees table:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
LEFT JOIN committees c USING(name);

-- left join clause with the USING syntax:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
LEFT JOIN committees c USING(name);

-- To find members who are not the committee members, you add a WHERE clause and IS NULL operator as follows:
SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
LEFT JOIN committees c USING(name)
WHERE c.committee_id IS NULL;


-- MySQL RIGHT JOIN clause
-- syntax of the right join:

SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
RIGHT JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

 -- left join clause, the right clause also supports the USING syntax:
SELECT column_list 
FROM table_1 
RIGHT JOIN table_2 USING (column_name);

-- To find rows in the right table that does not have corresponding rows in the left table, you also use a WHERE clause with the IS NULL operator:
SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
RIGHT JOIN committees c on c.name = m.name;


-- right join to join the members and committees tables:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
RIGHT JOIN committees c on c.name = m.name;


-- right join clause with the USING syntax:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
RIGHT JOIN committees c USING(name);

-- To find the committee members who are not in the members table, you use this query:
SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
RIGHT JOIN committees c USING(name)
WHERE m.member_id IS NULL;


-- MySQL CROSS JOIN clause
-- syntax to cross join
SELECT select_list
FROM table_1
CROSS JOIN table_2;

-- cross join clause to join the members with the committees tables:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
CROSS JOIN committees c;

-- Grouping data

SELECT 
    c1, c2,..., cn, aggregate_function(ci)
FROM
    table
WHERE
    where_conditions
GROUP BY c1 , c2,...,cn;

-- group values of the order’s status into subgroups, you use the GROUP BY clause with the status column as the following query:
SELECT 
    status
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY status;

-- the GROUP BY clause returns unique occurrences of status values. It works like the DISTINCT operator as shown in the following query:

SELECT DISTINCT
    status
FROM
    orders;

-- Using MySQL GROUP BY with aggregate functions

SELECT 
    status, COUNT(*)
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY status;

-- To get the total amount of all orders by status, you join the orders table with the orderdetails 
-- table and use the SUM function to calculate the total amount. See the following query:

SELECT 
    status, 
    SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS amount
FROM
    orders
INNER JOIN orderdetails 
    USING (orderNumber)
GROUP BY 
    status;

-- the following query returns the order numbers and the total amount of each order.
SELECT 
    orderNumber,
    SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS total
FROM
    orderdetails
GROUP BY 
    orderNumber;

-- Sub Queries
SELECT 
    lastName, firstName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    officeCode IN (SELECT 
            officeCode
        FROM
            offices
        WHERE
            country = 'USA');

-- the following query returns the customer who has the highest payment.
SELECT 
    customerNumber, 
    checkNumber, 
    amount
FROM
    payments
WHERE
    amount = (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM payments);


SELECT*
